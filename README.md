# Soul Voyage #

**Strange Attractor:**
One player, four friends - coordinate with your team to guide a ship through the realms of space with the use of magical forces.

**Basic Summary:**
There will be controls at all four corners of the screen (like a magnet that can be turned on or off), which allows for multiple people to control a single character.  There will be obstacles and enemies to avoid/defeat, which may differ depending on the game mode.

**Major Features:**

* Main character is controlled by four buttons on the corners of the screen, which act as magnets that “pull” the character in that direction 
* Particle systems to illustrate what direction the player is being pulled 
* Procedurally generated obstacles/enemies that make the game harder over time / as you progress 
* Different types of obstacles and enemies, for example: 
    * Obstacles can block the way so that the player cannot move in that direction
    * Obstacles can have a force (attractive or repulsive) that affects the character and must be counteracted by the players
    * Obstacles that change the behavior of the controls (for example, instead of acting like magnets that pull the character in, the controls may switch over to acting like air jets that push the character away)
    * Obstacles (passive enemies) such as mines that do damage to the character
    * Enemies (active enemies) that actively try to follow and damage the character
* Multiple play modes 
* Game Center integration for high scores and achievements. 

**Art Considerations:**
The game will have a simplistic and clean art style, featuring mostly monochromatic characters of common shapes and simple particle systems.
